- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kevin-McIntyre
- 👀 I’m interested in...

            1. Academically: Epidemiology. Specifically I am interested in how to improve surgical safety globally through analyzing specific causes of death in the perioperative
                                           period. I am also interested in pushing the field forward through new methodology or, more accurately, applying methods that are not 
                                           yet used in Global Surgery.
                                           
            2. Personally: Rugby (particularly New Zealand rugby), Judo, Star Wars and reading as many different books as I can get my hands on.
            
- 🌱 I’m currently learning epidemiology through my PhD in Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of Western Ontario, London, Canada.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on epidemiological methods, surgical analyses and COVID-19 analysis.
